              "'Let\\'s be honest, most of the make money online stuff is total BS. You\\'ve got people telling you to buy their drop shipping course, do shitty online jobs that pay lower than minimum wage, or just get famous. But what if you just want a simple remote job that you can do quietly at night without pretending to be an entrepreneur or starting some weird side hustle? That\\'s what this video is. These 12 jobs are boring. They\\'re kind of simple, but they\\'re real. And some pay 15 an hour, and some pay 50. and none of them ask for a degree or any experience. And these jobs are literally flying under the radar just like Bitcoin was in 2016. But they\\'re not going to stay that way for long. So, let\\'s get right into it. All right, so first up on the list is Prolific. And let\\'s be clear, paid online surveys are a scam. They\\'re going to pay you like 30 cents for 20 minutes of work filling out a form. I tried it myself. It\\'s just a waste of time. But Prolific is different, and they pay a minimum of eight bucks an hour. But the average and what most people get paid is $15 per hour for just doing simple surveys. They\\'re actually a legit platform used by top universities and companies to collect data. And the best thing is that they don\\'t pay you in annoying gift cards or cash back and things like that. You actually get real money straight to your PayPal account. And they have plenty of different tasks on their website with one being released every 2 minutes. And this is something that you can do an hour or two in the evenings and add hundreds of dollars every month to your paycheck, which is pretty cool. So, I know it sounds too good to be true, but they\\'re actually working with thousands of organizations like Google, Stanford, Oxford University, and so on. So, it makes sense. And you can actually get up and running in about 15 minutes or so. And then they\\'re going to be matching you with various tasks. So, instead of you having to search, all tasks that you receive are going to be tailored to you already. And of course, you can then choose which ones that you want to do. So, you know, it\\'s not going to make rent, but it can add a small stream of extra income in your spare time, so you\\'re not entirely relying on just a job or something that you can lose and get fired from. Because the more streams of income that you have, the better and the safer you are. So, I\\'ll give it a score of, let\\'s say, 7 out of 10. All right, next up. Did you know that you can make money just answering homework questions at 11 p.m.? It\\'s easy, and all you do is search for StudyPool. Once you land on their website, click become a tutor in the upper right corner and you\\'re then ready to apply and they accept people from literally anywhere. So, how the payment works on this website is that you basically get paid per question that you answer. And we can look at the recent questions posted by students which pay between $3 to $40 for answering the questions. So, the only thing that you would do to get this payment is that you would click start answering typing up some good stuff and then get paid. Simple as that. You basically just type on your keyboard and boom, the money is going to be there. Some users make over $1,000 a month. And if we look at their highest earners here, some have actually made over $70,000 just answering questions in their spare time, which I think is pretty cool. And if you\\'re thinking, okay, I have no skills. Who can I actually tutor? What questions can I answer? There are hundreds of different categories for you to explore. And you can even help with English or a foreign language. So, look, it\\'s pretty boring, I\\'ll be honest, but it pays. and it\\'s real. And what it is is simply homework help on demand, paid per answer. So, I\\'ll give it a score of 8 out of 10. All right, moving on. And the next one, I\\'m going to butcher the name completely. It\\'s called Aloa. If you want to work at night without a boss watching over you, this is going to be perfect for you because they literally hire people with no experience. And in this case, I mean it. Head over to the Allar website or whatever it\\'s called. find careers in the top right corner again and then just select your region because they hire worldwide. So what\\'s the job that they\\'re talking about? Well, basically Allerica hires you to handle customer support for companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, OpenAI, and various other top companies. And all that you need is going to be a decent headset and microphone so it doesn\\'t sound when you talk to people. You\\'ll also need a quiet room, so no like loud fans or noises in the background. As well as a basic understanding of how to not lose it when somebody says, \"Can I speak to your supervisor for the 10th time today?\" So, the work itself is pretty simple, though. You\\'ll basically just be logging in from home and answering calls, chats, or emails, and simply put, help customers with their problems in whatever way that they need help with. So, I\\'m going to be honest. When I first heard about this, I was skeptical. remote work, flexible hours, no degree. It sounds like a dream and it sounds fake, right? So, I looked them up on Indeed and the company\\'s legit. They\\'re very legit. They\\'ve got over 20,000 reviews on Indeed, and they\\'ve been around for many, many years. They\\'re not some new imaginary company or some AI scam hiring like we see all the time now. But, of course, there are going to be some downsides, and I want to be honest about that with you guys. So, the average pay is between $10 and $20 per hour depending on the role and the experience. And uh yeah, their ratings are not great. Some people love the flexibility. Others say the work is really repetitive and their calls are non-stop and it pays lower than it should. So, that said, if you\\'re looking for a simple remote job that you can do at night, this could be your way in. And I\\'ll still give it an opportunity score of 7 out of 10. Next up is number four. Do people always ask you for help with something? Well, now you can get paid for it instead while still in your pajamas and without leaving the comfort of your home. Just Answers is a website where experts get paid to answer people\\'s questions online. It\\'s simple. You just create a profile and get verified. And once you\\'re verified, you can start answering user questions anytime that you want to. And basically how it works is that you get paid per question that you answer. It\\'s simple, right? So here\\'s how much you can realistically make. The typical payment is about $7.50 to $11.50. 50 per answer, depending on the category, of course, some are going to pay way more. And the model is proven. I mean, there are people earning between$2 to $4,000 per month and some even more by going really hard at this. Doing it in their spare time, that\\'s pretty cool. Although, I think if you\\'re earning like 4K, they\\'re probably working it full-time. But your earning potential depends on the category. So, if you\\'re, let\\'s say, a nurse, a lawyer, a tech expert, or a mechanic, people are going to be willing to pay way more for an answer because it matters more to them than some language question. I\\'ll give this one a score of 8 out of 10 for now because I\\'m not sure how AI is going to impact this one. I can just expect that AI is going to have a big impact because at least the easy questions should be able to get answered by AI eventually or now at least. So, we\\'ll see how it plays out. And it also requires some skills to be qualified and that\\'s really the only downside for now. All right, so the next remote job is for anybody with no experience required and no skills whatsoever. And you can work from home during evenings. And it\\'s boring, yes, but it\\'s real. And that\\'s being a trya tester. They pay between $5 and $30 per test. And you could realistically make $100 a day if you go at it. So, have you ever clicked on a website and thought, \"This website just sucks.\" Congratulations. You\\'re then now qualified to be a try tester. That\\'s all you need. You get paid to complain because try pays for feedback on websites, apps, and user experiences. And a test might take like 10 to 20 minutes. You\\'ll basically just be recording the screen and using a microphone. Try is going to be showing you a website and then ask for your feedback and you\\'re going to be clicking around looking for bugs and problems and record your thoughts from using the site. Then you just fill in a form and you submit the feedback and you get paid. Easy, right? Now, you guys know that I\\'m always suspicious, so I did some more digging on this. Try was formerly known as Try My UI and they\\'ve been around since 2015 based in Salt Lake City, Utah. They are legit, but the reviews are mixed. Still, if you just want a simple way to make some extra cash, it will do the job. It gets a 7 out of 10 for me. Next up, if you can type fast, this might be one of the easiest ways to make money online. And yeah, I know you\\'ve probably seen like 50 writing jobs already where the pay is trash or it\\'s just a scam. So, I want to show you Textroker. Now, Textroker isn\\'t perfect, but it\\'s one of the few that\\'s actually real. And here\\'s why. They\\'ve been around since 2005. They actually pay on time, and there\\'s no back and forth between clients. It\\'s just right, get paid, and move on to the next job. And you can literally start this week if you just have a pulse. So, how much money can you expect to make? Of course, it\\'s not going to be the best pay since it requires no experience, but realistically, $10 to $25 an hour depending on the speed and the quality and essentially how fast and well you can type. So, here\\'s how it works, okay? Head over to their website and then they will ask you to fill in a very simple writing sample. And don\\'t worry, it\\'s super simple and short just to see if you can write. They\\'ll then give you a rating between 1 and five and you\\'re in. Now, you can start writing and you will be assigned work according to your rating. So, a higher rating means more money for you. So, make sure to put effort into the writing sample so you get a very good rating. And that\\'s pretty much it. You write, submit, and get paid every single week. You\\'re not going to get rich from this, but it works. And he gets an eight out of 10 from me. Next up is fancy pants. No, fancy hands. Did you know that Napoleon had over 100 personal assistants? That\\'s how he ran an empire. He didn\\'t do everything himself. He just gave orders and let other people handle the details. Now, obviously, you\\'re not going to be working for Napoleon, I think, but there are a lot of people today who need help booking appointments, doing research, cancelling stuff, and they\\'ll pay you money to do it. things that anybody with Google and a brain can do. So, Fancy Pants is a company that hires you to do the easy tasks for busy people, people that have too much time on their plates, basically. You don\\'t need a degree, any experience, or any skills whatsoever, and it takes like 5 minutes to get started. Just find their website, you apply, pass a simple test, and once you\\'re accepted, you get access to a list of various tasks. You can then choose which tasks that you want to do. And if you don\\'t like talking on the phone, for example, no problem. just pick another task. And what about the pay? Well, the money is usually based on how many tasks that you complete, and it\\'s often about $3 to$10 per task, and most take about 15 to 30 minutes. So, the more efficient that you\\'ll make, the more money you\\'ll make, and it gets an eight for me. Now, I\\'ve got a really exciting remote job up for you next. In 2025, people are earning from home by just talking on Cambi. You can sit on your couch talking and cashing in. And it\\'s low stress, no pressure, and the only job where talking too much is even in the job description. Wait, what is this job? You get paid to jump on calls with students from all around the world, like Japan, Brazil, or Saudi Arabia. It\\'s like FaceTime, but you\\'re the smart friend, and somebody\\'s paying you for small talk with no experience required, just great English skills. And you get paid by the minute, and you can set your own hours. And yes, you could even get paid at 2 a.m. if you want to. You\\'re not going to get rich from this. I mean, the pay is mediocre at best, but it\\'s flexible, really chill, and consistent. And if you like talking to people, you can now get paid for it, too. 7 out of 10 for me. All right, so moving on. AI is everywhere now. And this is your chance to get on the train and make money from AI. If you can click a mouse, follow instructions, and not fall asleep when you do so, you can do this job from remote tasks. It\\'s really beginner friendly. You set your own schedule and it requires no degree, no resume and no interview whatsoever. Simply head over to Remo Tasks and sign up on the website and your job is basically to help AI learn and improve. You\\'re like the human babysitter for AI saying that\\'s going to be a stop sign. That\\'s going to be a cat. That\\'s a share over and over again so the AI can learn and improve. So you\\'re kind of helping AI replace us one step at a time, but at least you get money for it. And you will also get paid per task and not per hour. So you\\'re going to be earning more as you become more efficient. But I would say realistically you can expect to make between five and $20 per hour. More advanced tasks pay more but require you to pass a short training beforehand. I would say gets a six out of five from me. Okay. So for the next job, let\\'s cut all the BS and jump right into it. Here is the website live ops. You\\'ve heard of a million call center jobs, but this one is going to be different. You\\'re not an employee. You\\'re a remote contractor, which means pick your own hours and set your own schedule. There are no set shifts, no commuting whatsoever, no dealing with co-workers or office drama. It\\'s just you, a phone, and a script making about $15 to $20 an hour from the comfort of your own home. Pretty cool. So, if you\\'re fine with working weekends or the night shift, you can also make even more money. Just click apply, pass a simple background check. I think if you have a criminal record, that could be a problem, but it depends. And once approved, you can start scheduling your hours. That\\'s really it. Just log in when you\\'re available, even in your pajamas, and get paid for talking to people. So, look, it\\'s going to be boring. It\\'s very repetitive, but it pays from home, and you control everything. And it also gives you some work experience. So, 9 out of 10 from me. All right. Next up is going to be ACD Direct. It\\'s a remote job in the BO business process outsourcing industry, and it takes about 70 minutes to get started and get hired and start getting paid. So, let me explain exactly how this works. To land the job, you really only need a few things. You need a private room or somewhere to work free of background noises. You need a Windows computer. Mac users are not going to be eligible for this one, unfortunately. And you\\'ll need a high-speed internet connection, a minimum 10 megabits per second upload, and 25 download. And finally, a computer headset with a microphone that you can talk through. So, start by registering on their ACD agents website. Get approved, complete a test, log in, sign a contract, and do a test call. And that\\'s pretty much it. The work is remote. It\\'s flexible. There\\'s no pressure because you\\'re receiving phone calls. You\\'re not calling people yourself. And again, night and weekend shifts are usually in higher demand and higher paid, meaning that if you want to make more money and you can work other hours and you\\'re fine with that, that\\'s a great way to do so. And once you\\'re approved, there are various BO jobs that you can take, usually in customer service. So, it gets a 7 out of 10 for me. The next up is ACX. If you like reading, why not get paid for reading the same stuff out loud? because now you can. ACX stands for Audiobook Creation Exchange and it\\'s owned by Audible, which is Amazon\\'s platform for audiobooks. ACX connects narrators, you with authors and publishers who want to turn their books into audiobooks. They\\'re looking for all sorts of voices, and you don\\'t need to be a voice actor. You just need a high-quality microphone, great pronunciation, and not seem like you\\'re reading off a serial box like I do sometimes. So, you basically just create a profile, you upload a voice sample, and once you\\'re in, browse all the open projects. And if you\\'re selected for a project, you just record the chapters, submit the files, and payment is about $50 to $100 per hour. And that\\'s talking about finished audio hours. And you can also make money from royalties on audiobook sales depending on your agreement. Now, here\\'s the caveat, okay? Top narrators can make hundreds or even thousands depending on how well the book sells. But there\\'s another side of the story. Most people that do this barely make ends meet, especially with the competition and the introduction of artificial intelligence. So, yes, there\\'s going to be total freedom, but this is more of a long-term play, and it takes time and effort to build yourself up in this industry. I don\\'t know if it\\'s the best one to get into as a beginner if you just want to get a remote job fast. And I want to be completely honest about that as well. If you\\'re just looking for an entry-level remote job with a high pay quickly, I\\'ll leave a link to course careers in the description. And if you want to earn today, I got even more remote jobs for you on the screen. Click here somewhere on the screen to see all of it. And thanks for watching.'"

            "Let's be honest, most of the make money online stuff is total BS. You've got people telling you to buy their drop shipping course, do shitty online jobs that pay lower than minimum wage or just get famous. But what if you just want a simple, remote job that you can do quietly at night without pretending to be an entrepreneur or starting some weird side hustle? That's what this video is. These 12 jobs are boring. They're kind of simple, but they're real, And some pay 15 an hour and some pay 50. and none of them ask for a degree or any experience. And these jobs are literally flying under the radar, just like Bitcoin was in 2016.. But they're not going to stay that way for long, So let's get right into it, All right. so first up on the list is Prolific, And let's be clear: paid online surveys are a scam. They're going to pay you like 30 cents for 20 minutes of work filling out a form. I tried it myself. It's just a waste of time. But Prolific is different and they pay a minimum of eight bucks an hour. But the average and what most people get paid is $15 per hour for just doing simple surveys. They're actually a legit platform used by top universities and companies to collect data, And the best thing is that they don't pay you in annoying gift cards or cash back and things like that. You actually get real money straight to your PayPal account And they have plenty of different tasks on their website, with one being released every 2 minutes, And this is something that you can do an hour or two in the evenings and add hundreds of dollars every month to your paycheck, which is pretty cool. So I know it sounds too good to be true, but they're actually working with thousands of organizations like Google, Stanford, Oxford University and so on. So it makes sense And you can actually get up and running in about 15 minutes or so, And then they're going to be matching you with various tasks. So, instead of you having to search, all tasks that you receive are going to be tailored to you already And, of course, you can then choose which ones that you want to do. So you know it's not going to make rent, but it can add a small stream of extra income in your spare time, so you're not entirely relying on just a job or something that you can lose and get fired from, Because the more streams of income that you have, the better and the safer you are. So I'll give it a score of, let's say, 7 out of 10.. All right, next up. Did you know that you can make money just answering homework questions at 11 pm? It's easy and all you do is search for StudyPool. Once you land on their website, click become a tutor in the upper right corner and you're then ready to apply, and they accept people from literally anywhere. So how the payment works on this website is that you basically get paid per question that you answer, And we can look at the recent questions posted by students which pay between $3 to $40 for answering the questions. So the only thing that you would do to get this payment is that you would click, start answering, typing up some good stuff, and then get paid. Simple as that. You basically just type on your keyboard and boom, the money is going to be there. Some users make over $1,000 a month And if we look at their highest earners here, some have actually made over $70,000 just answering questions in their spare time, which I think is pretty cool. And if you're thinking, okay, I have no skills, Who can I actually tutor? What questions can I answer? There are hundreds of different categories for you to explore, And you can even help with English or a foreign language. So, look, it's pretty boring, I'll be honest, but it pays and it's real, And what it is is simply homework- help on demand, paid per answer. So I'll give it a score of 8 out of 10.. All right, moving on And the next one. I'm going to butcher the name completely. It's called Aloa. If you want to work at night without a boss watching over you, this is going to be perfect for you, because they literally hire people with no experience, And in this case I mean it. Head over to the Allar website or whatever it's called, find careers in the top right corner again and then just select your region, because they hire worldwide. So what's the job that they're talking about? Well, basically, Allerica hires you to handle customer support for companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, OpenAI and various other top companies, And all that you need is going to be a decent headset and microphone so it doesn't sound when you talk to people. You'll also need a quiet room, so no like loud fans or noises in the background, As well as a basic understanding of how to not lose it when somebody says: \"Can I speak to your supervisor for the 10th time today\". So the work itself is pretty simple, though. You'll basically just be logging in from home and answering calls, chats or emails and simply put help customers with their problems in whatever way that they need help with. So I'm going to be honest: When I first heard about this, I was skeptical. remote work, flexible hours, no degree: It sounds like a dream and it sounds fake, right. So I looked them up on Indeed and the company's legit. They're very legit. They've got over 20,000 reviews on Indeed and they've been around for many, many years. They're not some new imaginary company or some AI scam hiring like we see all the time now. But of course, there are going to be some downsides and I want to be honest about that with you guys. So the average pay is between $10 and $20 per hour, depending on the role and the experience, And, uh yeah, their ratings are not great. Some people love the flexibility. Others say the work is really repetitive and their calls are non-stop and it pays lower than it should. So, that said, if you're looking for a simple, remote job that you can do at night, this could be your way in, And I'll still give it an opportunity. score of 7 out of 10.. Next up is number four, Do people always ask you for help with something? Well, now you can get paid for it instead, while still in your pajamas and without leaving the comfort of your home. Just Answers is a website where experts get paid to answer people's questions online. It's simple: You just create a profile and get verified, And once you're verified, you can start answering user questions anytime that you want to. And basically how it works is that you get paid per question that you answer. It's simple, right? So here's how much you can realistically make. The typical payment is about $7.50 to $11.50.. 50 per answer, depending on the category. of course, some are going to pay way more And the model is proven. I mean, there are people earning between$2 to $4,000 per month, and some even more, by going really hard at this, Doing it in their spare time. that's pretty cool, Although I think if you're earning like 4K, they're probably working it full-time. But your earning potential depends on the category. So if you're, let's say, a nurse, a lawyer, a tech expert or a mechanic, people are going to be willing to pay way more for an answer, because it matters more to them than some language question. I'll give this one a score of 8 out of 10 for now, because I'm not sure how AI is going to impact this one. I can just expect that AI is going to have a big impact, because at least the easy questions should be able to get answered by AI eventually, or now at least. So we'll see how it plays out. And it also requires some skills to be qualified, and that's really the only downside for now. All right, so the next remote job is for anybody with no experience required and no skills whatsoever, And you can work from home during evenings. And it's boring, yes, but it's real, And that's being a trya tester. They pay between $5 and $30 per test, And you could realistically make $100 a day if you go at it. So have you ever clicked on a website and thought, \"This website just sucks\"? Congratulations. You're, then, now qualified to be a try tester. That's all you need. You get paid to complain, because try pays for feedback on websites, apps and user experiences, And a test might take like 10 to 20 minutes. You'll basically just be recording the screen and using a microphone. Try is going to be showing you a website and then ask for your feedback, and you're going to be clicking around looking for bugs and problems and record your thoughts from using the site. Then you just fill in a form and you submit the feedback and you get paid Easy right Now. you guys know that I'm always suspicious, so I did some more digging on this. Try was formerly known as Try My UI, and they've been around since 2015, based in Salt Lake City, Utah. They are legit, but the reviews are mixed. Still, if you just want a simple way to make some extra cash, it will do the job. It gets a 7 out of 10 for me. Next up, if you can type fast, this might be one of the easiest ways to make money online. And yeah, I know you've probably seen like 50 writing jobs already where the pay is trash or it's just a scam. So I want to show you Textroker Now. Textroker isn't perfect, but it's one of the few that's actually real And here's why They've been around since 2005.. They actually pay on time and there's no back and forth between clients. It's just right: get paid and move on to the next job And you can literally start this week if you just have a pulse. So how much money can you expect to make? Of course, it's not going to be the best pay, since it requires no experience, but realistically $10 to $25 an hour, depending on the speed and the quality and, essentially, how fast and well you can type. So here's how it works. okay, Head over to their website and then they will ask you to fill in a very simple writing sample- And don't worry, it's super simple and short- just to see if you can write. They'll then give you a rating between 1 and five and you're in. Now you can start writing and you will be assigned work according to your rating. So a higher rating means more money for you. So make sure to put effort into the writing sample so you get a very good rating And that's pretty much it. You write, submit and get paid every single week. You're not going to get rich from this, but it works And he gets an eight out of 10 from me. Next up is fancy pants, No fancy hands. Did you know that Napoleon had over 100 personal assistants? That's how he ran an empire. He didn't do everything himself, He just gave orders and let other people handle the details. Now, obviously you're not going to be working for Napoleon, I think, but there are a lot of people today who need help booking appointments, doing research, cancelling stuff, and they'll pay you money to do it, things that anybody with Google and a brain can do. So Fancy Pants is a company that hires you to do the easy tasks for busy people, people that have too much time on their plates. basically, You don't need a degree, any experience or any skills whatsoever, and it takes like 5 minutes to get started. Just find their website, you apply, pass a simple test and once you're accepted, you get access to a list of various tasks. You can then choose which tasks that you want to do, And if you don't like talking on the phone, for example, no problem, just pick another task. And what about the pay? Well, the money is usually based on how many tasks that you complete, and it's often about $3 to$10 per task, and most take about 15 to 30 minutes. So the more efficient that you'll make, the more money you'll make, and it gets an eight for me. Now I've got a really exciting remote job up for you. next, In 2025, people are earning from home by just talking on Cambi. You can sit on your couch talking and cashing in, And it's low stress, no pressure, and the only job where talking too much is even in the job description. Wait, what is this job? You get paid to jump on calls with students from all around the world, like Japan, Brazil or Saudi Arabia. It's like FaceTime, but you're the smart friend and somebody's paying you for small talk, with no experience required, just great English skills, And you get paid by the minute and you can set your own hours And, yes, you could even get paid at 2 am if you want to. You're not going to get rich from this. I mean, the pay is mediocre at best, but it's flexible, really chill and consistent, And if you like talking to people, you can now get paid for it too. 7 out of 10 for me, All right. so moving on, AI is everywhere now, And this is your chance to get on the train and make money from AI. If you can click a mouse, follow instructions and not fall asleep when you do so, you can do this job from remote tasks. It's really beginner friendly. You set your own schedule and it requires no degree, no resume and no interview whatsoever. Simply head over to Remo Tasks and sign up on the website and your job is basically to help AI learn and improve. You're like the human babysitter for AI saying: that's going to be a stop sign, That's going to be a cat. That's a share over and over again so the AI can learn and improve. So you're kind of helping AI replace us, one step at a time, but at least you get money for it. And you will also get paid per task and not per hour. So you're going to be earning more as you become more efficient, But I would say, realistically, you can expect to make between five and $20 per hour. More advanced tasks pay more but require you to pass a short training beforehand. I would say gets a six out of five from me. Okay. So for the next job, let's cut all the BS and jump right into it. Here is the website: live ops. You've heard of a million call center jobs, but this one is going to be different. You're not an employee, You're a remote contractor, which means pick your own hours and set your own schedule. There are no set shifts, no commuting whatsoever, no dealing with co-workers or office drama. It's just you, a phone and a script, making about $15 to $20 an hour from the comfort of your own home- Pretty cool. So if you're fine with working weekends or the night shift, you can also make even more money. Just click, apply, pass a simple background check. I think if you have a criminal record that could be a problem, but it depends. And once approved, you can start scheduling your hours. That's really it Just log in when you're available, even in your pajamas, and get paid for talking to people. So, look, it's going to be boring, It's very repetitive, but it pays from home and you control everything And it also gives you some work experience. So 9 out of 10 from me: All right. Next up is going to be ACD Direct. It's a remote job in the BO business process outsourcing industry and it takes about 70 minutes to get started and get hired and start getting paid. So let me explain exactly how this works. To land the job, you really only need a few things. You need a private room or somewhere to work, free of background noises. You need a Windows computer- Mac users are not going to be eligible for this one, unfortunately- And you'll need a high-speed internet connection, a minimum 10 megabits per second upload and 25 download- And finally, a computer headset with a microphone that you can talk through. So start by registering on their ACD agents website, Get approved, complete a test, log in, sign a contract and do a test call, And that's pretty much it. The work is remote, It's flexible, There's no pressure because you're receiving phone calls, You're not calling people yourself. And, again, night and weekend shifts are usually in higher demand and higher paid, meaning that if you want to make more money and you can work other hours and you're fine with that, that's a great way to do so And once you're approved, there are various BO jobs that you can take, usually in customer service. So it gets a 7 out of 10 for me. The next up is ACX. If you like reading, why not get paid for reading the same stuff out loud? because now you can. ACX stands for Audiobook Creation Exchange and it's owned by Audible, which is Amazon's platform for audiobooks. ACX connects narrators, you, with authors and publishers who want to turn their books into audiobooks. They're looking for all sorts of voices and you don't need to be a voice actor. You just need a high-quality microphone, great pronunciation and not seem like you're reading off a serial box, like I do sometimes. So you basically just create a profile, you upload a voice sample and, once you're in, browse all the open projects And if you're selected for a project, you just record the chapters, submit the files and payment is about $50 to $100 per hour. And that's talking about finished audio hours. And you can also make money from royalties on audiobook sales, depending on your agreement. Now here's the caveat. okay, Top narrators can make hundreds or even thousands, depending on how well the book sells. But there's another side of the story. Most people that do this barely make ends meet, especially with the competition and the introduction of artificial intelligence. So, yes, there's going to be total freedom, but this is more of a long-term play and it takes time and effort to build yourself up in this industry. I don't know if it's the best one to get into as a beginner. if you just want to get a remote job fast- And I want to be completely honest about that as well- If you're just looking for an entry-level remote job with a high pay quickly, I'll leave a link to course careers in the description. And if you want to earn today, I got even more remote jobs for you on the screen. Click here somewhere on the screen to see all of it, And thanks for watching.\n"
